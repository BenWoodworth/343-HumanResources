# How Permissions Work
## Permission Structure
Permissions consist of subpermissions separated by periods.  
Subpermissions can contain the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, and `_`.  
Users can be given permissions with `*` to match any subpermission.  
Users can be given permissions with `**` to match any remaining subpermissions.

## Examples
| User's Permission | Test Permission  | Has Permission?  |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| hr.employees      | hr.employees     | True             |
| hr.*              | hr.employees     | True             |
| hr.**             | hr.employees     | True             |
| hr.**             | hr.employees.add | True             |
| hr.employees      | hr               | False            |
| hr.employees      | hr.employees.add | False            |
| hr.*              | hr               | False            |
| hr.*              | hr.users         | False            |
| hr.*              | hr.employees.add | False            |
| hr.**             | hr               | False            |
